You can access as many resources as you need almost immediately by paying only for what you use. Cloud computing provides an easy way to access servers, storage, databases and a full range of application services over the Internet. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or “Swiss made” n’cloud.swiss operate and manage the network-attached hardware needed for these application services, providing and using the resources you need through a web application.</h3></P>
