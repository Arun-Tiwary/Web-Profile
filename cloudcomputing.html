        <P><h3>Whether you run apps that share photos with millions of mobile users or support critical business operations in your organization, the cloud is a technology providing quick access to flexible and cost-effective IT resources. When it comes to cloud computing, you do not have to invest in hardware in advance or spend a lot of time managing it. Instead, you can provide the exact type and size of computing resources you need to implement your latest breakthrough idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need almost immediately by paying only for what you use. Cloud computing provides an easy way to access servers, storage, databases and a full range of application services over the Internet. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or “Swiss made” n’cloud.swiss operate and manage the network-attached hardware needed for these application services, providing and using the resources you need through a web application.</h3></P>
        <p><h4>Cloud computing consists of three main types, commonly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Choosing the right cloud computing type consists in knowing your needs to achieve an optimal level of control with worrying about unnecessary tasks.</h4></p>
        <h1>Impact on Industry</h1>
        <p><h3>Earlier times companies used to buy infrastructure which was capable enough to cost money, but now due to cloud computing, it is saving lots of money from companies. now companies don’t need to buy and install heavy servers systems and other infrastructures.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>Businesses are now using data from the social media platform and cloud-based information to get a better vision of innovation and customer requirements. cloud technology impacting our world on many levels such as health, education finance, etc . cloud technology is giving a digital platform for shaping strategy and guiding our next generation enterprises how to migrate and participate in the ecosystem.</h3></p>
        <h3>Cloud security and data encryption have come a long way. Cloud has had its share of data breaches in the past. Today, the security landscape on the cloud has evolved. Data on the cloud is oftentimes more secure than data on-premise.
            Enforcing security on-premise comes down to the security personnel you’ve hired to keep track of security. In a company, this person is the IT dude. This dude has plenty of other headaches.
            The primary reason that most companies are vulnerable today is that they fail to keep up with the latest software patches on their servers which makes them sitting ducks.
            On Cloud, the security scales automatically with your data. On-Prem, if you were to add extra resources to handle last-minute loads there is a chance that in order to get it up and running quickly some security practices can get compromised or left for later after the fire is out.
            Having said that, Security is not a turnkey solution. Security is still a shared responsibility between you and the cloud provider.
            For example, AWS provides Multi-factor authentication (MFA) but it is up to the user to turn it on.
            You still have to do your part. But rest assured that the physical infrastructure, firewall, software updates, intrusion detection across all of the hardware and managed services come from the cloud provider.
            Like security, compliance is also a shared responsibility between the Cloud provider and you. But, having a partner like Amazon, Google or Microsoft while navigating these waters can save a lot of time and money.
            Google claims that its cloud security was designed by a 700 member engineering team. Here is a white paper on Google’s cloud security</h3>
